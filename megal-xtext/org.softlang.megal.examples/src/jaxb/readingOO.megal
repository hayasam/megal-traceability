 * De-serialization was already discussed in a designated module, but the derivation of the
 * corresponding function for de-serialization was not yet explained. To this end, we need to
 * assume actual program code which makes use of appropriate library functionality to issue
 * de-serialization. (There is a similar module for serialization).
