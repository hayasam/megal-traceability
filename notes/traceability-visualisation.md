# Traceability Visualisation
This note summarizes the three most common **traceability visualisation techniques**: 
- Matrices 
- Corss-References 
- Graphs

## Traceability Matrices
Traceability Matrices visualise the traceability of *n* traced artifacts in form of a 2D grid.
This grid has at most *n²* cells.
In its most simplistic form, the coordinate *(x,y)* denotes the existence of a traceability link between artifacts x and y with a bullet.
However, using a richer set of shapes, traceability matrices can provide additional information regarding the link's nature.
