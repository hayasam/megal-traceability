# Traceability Definitions

## Definition 1
*"Traceability is the ability to describe and follow the life of a software artifact and a means for modeling the realtions between software artifacts in an explicit way."* - Lago et al. [1]

## Definition 2
*"The ability to describe and follow the life of a requirement in both a fowards and backwards direction (i.e. from its origins, through its development and specifiacation to tits subsequent deployment and use, an through periods of on-going refinement in any of these phases)."* - Gotel and Finkelstein [2]

## Definition 3
*"[...] the ability to chronologically interrelate uniquely identifiable entities in a way that matters. [...] [It] refers to the capability for tracing artifacts along a set of chained [manual or automated] operations."* - Paige et al. [3]

## Definition 4
*"The degree to which a relationship can be established between two or more products of the development process, especially products having a prdecessor-successor or master-subordinate relationship to one another."* - IEEE [4]

## Definition 5
*"The degree to which each element in a software development products establishes its reason for existing."* - IEEE [4]
